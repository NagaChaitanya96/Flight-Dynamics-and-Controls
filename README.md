Assignments during the course work:

Assignment 1:

In this assignment, we are looking at 2 different longitudinal modes of the aircraft, i.e, phugoid & short period. Which can be analysed with the aid of eigen values obtained from the characteristic equation and depending on the sign of poles and zeros, we mention the stability of the aircraft. We are going to look at how the stability of the aircraft varies with the variation in various parameters like altitude, speed, change in CG location, mass & moment of inertia variation.

Assignment 2: 

First assignment checks the static stability concept. However, the second one, deals with the response obtained from the aircraft because of a dispersion given and an autopilot has been implemented for longitudinal mode as well as the lateral mode.
