# Flight-Dynamics-and-Controls
These are the two assignments performed during my Masters. 
Assignment 1 gives us the brief idea of how the different modes possible in the aircraft. For this, we analyse the eigen values from the characteristic equation and depending on the sign of poles and zeros, we mention the stability of the aircraft. In addition, by looking at the damping ratio, we can say about the oscillations obtained and how long the aircraft is  going to take to return to the initial position.In this assignment we are going to consider the effect of variation in different states on the modes are well analyzed.

Assignment 2: I have designed various controllers, PD, PI, PID for the longitudinal and the lateral stability aspects. Some of the modern control theory concepts like full state feedback are also implemented for the linear and nonlinear model variaiton.
