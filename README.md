# Flight-Dynamics-and-Controls
These are the two assignments performed during my Masters. Assignment 1 gives us the brief idea of how the different modes obtained in the aircraft in the case of longitudinal stability and the effects of variation of different states on the modes are well analyzed. In the second assignment, I have designed various controllers, PD, PI, PID for the longitudinal and the lateral stability aspects. Some of the modern control theory concepts like full state feedback are also implemented for the linear and nonlinear model variaiton.
