# Autopilots for various dynamic systems:

A dynamic system is subjected to various dispersions during its working condition. Especially, for an aircraft which is a 6 DOF body, even the slightest disturbance if not handeled properly, it will create a havoc. In order to validate its hadling qualities, we need to check on the stability and controllability of the aircraft. 

Static Stability: Is the initial response of the system to come to its initial position.
Dynamic Stability: It is the response of the vehicle to come back to its initial position after a certain period of time. 

Any system can be statically stable and its just a sufficient condition, however, dynamic stability is a necessary condition. In some cases, aircraft goes into the loops where, our dynamic stability and the pilot cannot handle, for those circumstances we need to have an autopilot. Therefore, here we are going to design various autopilot systems for Pitch and Bank angles. 

So for a linear model & non-linear models, we have the basic systems like PD, PID, PI systems and some modern control theory concepts like full state feedback are also implemented.
